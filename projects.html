            <h2>Road Accident Analysis</h2>
            <p>
            This project analyzes road accident data to identify patterns in crash
            frequency, severity, location, and contributing factors. The goal was to
            uncover high-risk conditions and provide data-driven insights that could
            support better traffic safety policies and preventive interventions.
            </p>
