        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>
            I’m a data analytics professional with a strong interest in data science 
            and analytical problem-solving. I enjoy working with data, asking better 
            questions, and building solutions that make decisions clearer and smarter.
        </p>

        <p>
            My background in statistics gives me a solid foundation in understanding 
            uncertainty, patterns, and relationships in data. I combine that with 
            programming skills in Python and SQL to turn raw data into meaningful insights.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Focus On</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Exploring and analyzing real-world datasets</li>
            <li>Building predictive and analytical models</li>
            <li>Writing efficient SQL queries and designing clean databases</li>
            <li>Creating clear visualizations and communicating insights</li>
            <li>Improving systems through data-driven thinking</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I am intentional about building depth, not just collecting skills. 
            Every project I take on is an opportunity to refine my technical 
            ability, strengthen my thinking, and create measurable value.
        </p>

        <p>
            Long term, I want to build scalable, technology-driven systems that create 
            real impact. For now, I’m focused on sharpening my skills, building a strong 
            portfolio, and collaborating on meaningful projects.
        </p>
